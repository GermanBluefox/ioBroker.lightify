### ioBroker.lightify

Adapter for OSRAM Lightify

Early code release

I've tried to use the same state names as the hue adapter.
The code isn't realy tested. If you want you can test the adapter.
no guarantee that everything works!

#### Requirements

#### Installation
Execute the following command in the iobroker root directory (e.g. in /opt/iobroker)
```
npm install iobroker.lightify
